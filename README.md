Portfolio-website
In this project, I was able to build A landing page with numerous sections using HTML and styling each section with some CSS whilst providing functionality with JAVASCRIPT. The goal of this project is to fundamentaly learn languages and frameworks that tackle a cerain obstacle I'm faced with (even tho i specialise in mostlty back-end).

I am required to build a portfolio to display my work as an aspiring Junior Software Engineer including the side projects i do tonenhance my day-to-day learning of software.
